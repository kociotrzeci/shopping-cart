# Shopping cart

Project is website of example shop, using APIs to fetch items, powered by REACT router

## What pages my website needs

Application contains 3 webpages:

- home
- shop
- cart
  Header contains state of application, and passing it to child elements

## Tests

Unfortunetly, i dont know easy way to test website build by REACT router, so tests only cover API fetch functionality
